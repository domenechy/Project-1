        Hi there! My name is <b>Yisel Domenech</b> and (once again) I'm a senior at <a href="https://www.kean.edu">Kean University</a>. 
        <br>
        I graduated from Kean University back in 2014 with a bachelor's degree in Business Management.
        <br>
        However, I had always been interested in the Technology field as well. Therefore, I found it
        <br>
        suitable and in my best interest to return back to school and earn a second bachelor's degree,
        <br>
        this time in Information Technology. If everything goes according to plan, 
        <br>
        I will be graduating with my second degree in May of 2022.
        <br>
        <br>
        Wondering if I might be a good fit for your company?
        <br>
        --->   Check out my <b>resume</b> and my <a style="font-weight:bold" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yisel-domenech-68800a127/"> Linkedin</a> profile
